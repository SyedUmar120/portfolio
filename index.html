    <h2 class="section-title fade-up">About</h2>
     <p class="section-text">
        I’m a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at KSR College of Engineering,
Thiruchengode, Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, currently maintaining a CGPA of 7.6 up to the
fourth semester.

My academic focus is centered on Java-based software development, where I’ve built
a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, and structured
problem-solving. I enjoy approaching challenges methodically—breaking problems
down, designing logical solutions, and implementing them through clean, readable,
and maintainable code.

Alongside Java, I work with HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I’m in the process of expanding
my knowledge in full stack Java development. This ongoing learning has helped me
understand how frontend interfaces, backend logic, and databases come together to
form complete, functional applications.

I’ve also gained practical exposure through two micro internships. At Rejola IT
Services, I was introduced to professional development environments and real-world
project workflows, helping me understand how theoretical concepts translate into
industry practices. Later, as a Cloud Computing Intern at Thiran360AI, I worked in a
project-based, mentored setting that strengthened my understanding of cloud
concepts, collaborative development, and solution-oriented thinking.

These experiences have reinforced my interest in building reliable software and
continuously improving my technical fundamentals. Currently, I’m focused on
deepening my core programming skills, building meaningful personal projects, and
preparing for internships and entry-level software engineering roles where I can
learn, contribute effectively, and grow as a developer.
